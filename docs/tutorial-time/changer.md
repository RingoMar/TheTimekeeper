# Specify a Timestamp
Users can specify a starting timestamp by appending ?time=`timestamp` to the URL in the address bar of their web browser / Browser Source. They should replace with the desired timestamp in `ISO 8601 format` (e.g., 2024-03-29T22:00:33Z).

# How to Convert Normal Time
Using a website such as [Timestamp Converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com) you can easily pick your desired time copy and start the counter like below:
